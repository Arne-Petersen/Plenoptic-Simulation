# Plenoptic-Simulation
Supplemental material to *T. Michels, A. Petersen, L. Palmieri, R. Koch - "Plenoptic Simulation"* published at TBA.

The .blend file contains a model for plenoptic cameras described in the paper. It allows the rendering of plenoptic image data exhibiting the same effects as images from real Raytrix or Lytro cameras.  
**Important:** Blender version 2.79 is needed in order to get correct results. For unknown reasons, the results of v2.76 show incorrect distortions.
