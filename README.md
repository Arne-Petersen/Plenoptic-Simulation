![Rendering exmaple for a plenoptic camera 2.0 setup](https://github.com/Arne-Petersen/Plenoptic-Simulation/images/preview.png)

The .blend file contains a model for plenoptic cameras described in the paper. It allows the rendering of plenoptic image data exhibiting the same effects as images from real Raytrix or Lytro cameras. Some rendering results and further explanations are given in this repository's [wiki](https://github.com/Arne-Petersen/Plenoptic-Simulation/wiki).

**Important:** Blender version 2.79 is needed in order to get correct results. For unknown reasons, the results of v2.76 show incorrect distortions.
